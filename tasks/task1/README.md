## Working wit task

1. When you have console open, type "npm test"
  * You will see unit tests failing
2. Start with implementing functions in src/index.js file
  * In tests, functions depend on each other, so better is to keep the order

Implementation required is indeed very short. Few lines, sometimes even 1 line.
